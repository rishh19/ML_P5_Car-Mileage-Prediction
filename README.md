## 📝 Overview
This project uses a regression model to estimate the Miles Per Gallon (MPG) of a car. It takes inputs such as cylinders, horsepower, weight, and acceleration to generate accurate predictions.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Python**: Core programming language.
* **Scikit-Learn**: For training the Machine Learning model.
* **Streamlit**: For building the web interface.
* **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation.

## 📂 Project Structure
* `app.py`: The main Streamlit application script.
* `car_mpg_model.pkl`: The trained model file.
* `Auto_MPG.csv`: The dataset used for training.
* `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies.
